    "text": "You can hear the chants of Beto here behind me. O'Rourke is shaking hands and taking pictures with people after a short speech in the middle of this field where he talked about health care and the importance of getting out to vote early. Now he's trying to convince people to get to the polls this morning to cast their ballot. O'Rourke has been traveling the state to get out to vote even without him here. Travis County saw massive turnout the first two days of early voting. More than 32,000 people voted in person each of the last two days. That's at least on pace with the presidential election in 2016. Add mail-in ballots and the number of total voters so far climbs to more than 80,000. One of those voters is Amber Alexander. She voted for the very first time this morning. I never thought my vote mattered but Beto being out there and telling us and demonstrating that if you put your mind to it you can achieve anything really inspired me. I've also got a 14-month-old. I'd say go Beto! His future is my life now so I just wanted to make sure I could give him the best future possible. Hopefully I can get a picture of shaking his hand and kissing the baby. That's my goal today. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.",
