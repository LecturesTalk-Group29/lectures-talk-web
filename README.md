# LecturesTalk: Making Lectures Interactive

## About
In today's digital-driven academic environment, students grapple with the dual challenges of navigating lengthy video lectures and ensuring that they retain crucial points from them. Often, they find themselves revisiting an entire lecture just to grasp a particular concept they might have missed. LecturesTalk emerges as a solution to this, acting as a personalized "search engine" for lectures, fundamentally altering the way students approach and absorb extended lecture content.

## Features

- **Lecture Summarization:** By simply inputting a video link, users receive both a detailed transcript and a concise summary. This ensures that the core of the lecture is captured, obviating the need to trudge through the entire content repeatedly.
  
- **Clickable Timestamps:** This feature shines particularly for students revisiting lectures. Each summarized point is linked with a timestamp, enabling students to zero in on exact moments or concepts they want to review, without the hassle of scanning the entire lecture.
  
- **Interactive Chat Function:** Surpassing traditional learning boundaries, our app's chat feature is not only interactive but also highly context-aware. When students have queries, the chat pulls information from the uploaded lecture, mirroring the insightful guidance one would expect in a professor's office hours, but without the wait.
