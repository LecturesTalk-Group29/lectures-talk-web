{"task":"transcribe","language":"english","duration":5636.89,"text":"Hi, guys, good morning. Morning, guys. Good morning, Artem. Good morning, Chris, David, Melvin, Shivam, how was your weekend, guys? Yes, yes, so we'll talk about that. So, let's go over the course outline real quick. I realized that we were behind one week, and I realized that's because last week there was no class. I'm going to go over the course outline with you guys one more time. So, I believe, and week six, we missed two weeks, well, it's one week, so it looks like we're behind two weeks. I'm going to go over the course outline real quick. So, now, the midterm is given out after reading week, okay? So, I'm going to be giving out the assignment one. The reading week is next week, and you guys will be given the midterm next week, right, which will be a take-home test. So, you'll be taking home an assignment, and you'll be doing it and handing it in the following week. Yes, first Monday we had no class, exactly. So, that's why we're behind. So, assignment one, I'm thinking about giving out because it says exercise two is here. So, I might give out assignment one probably next class along with the midterm next class. You'll do exercise two today. You'll do assignment one and the midterm when we get back. How about that? Yeah. Good question. No. So, the midterm will be due the following week, right? Assignment one, I'll give you guys two weeks to work on it. Do you still have labs? Do you still have, like, do you still have a lab this week, the week after? Do you have a lab that week? So, it will get more busy after reading week, okay? I also plan to hand back all your marks. So, during reading week, all your marks will be handed back. Okay. We could definitely talk about that when I give them both out. I will think about how long each will take. We'll talk about how long you guys will have to do them. So, this week we're going to talk about two topics, scene rendering and input handling. All right. So, objectives. Examine entity systems in concept and practice. This is scene handling. Explore the viewable area of our world and scrolls. You guys can actually go and download the code. It's in the description. It's in the description. It's in the description. It's in the description. It's in the description. It's in the description. It's in the description. It's in the description. You guys can go and download the code for WE5. It is here. It's called RenderWorld. Go ahead and download that. We're going to go through the code in the slides. So, implement tree-based scene graphs, rendering, and updating of many entities. Implement the composition of all elements to shape the world. Entity class. An entity represents some game element in the world. This can be other planes, friendly and enemy, projectiles, bullets and missiles, pickups, basically what the player can interact with. We're going to have a velocity attribute. Let's see what the definition looks like. So, entity. An entity can be like a player, like an object. So, like I said, it can be other planes. So, like in our RenderWorld, we have something called an airplane, right? If you guys open the code, you'll see here it is aircraft, and it comes from the entity object. It's here. Right? So, entity actually comes from Cnode. Again, my project is not built properly and stuff. I'm just showing you guys the code, so you guys will have to go ahead and get yours to work and build everything. But entity comes from Cnode, okay? And Cnode should be a part of the code from the book. Here it is. Cnode. And Cnode has an update in it, right? It has a draw function, so we can use it to actually create entities. It has positioning. So, it pretty much is making up for what an entity will be able to do. Entity can actually move around the scene, have speed, velocity, right? And then our aircraft works on entity. So, you can have different aircraft types. You can have an Eagle or Raptor, right? And they all have a texture and a sprite on them. All right? So, you can actually use an entity class to create an aircraft or to create your own game object, right? And all it needs is a texture and a constructor. And you can actually make your own constructor if you want. But you can use texture, which we can use to draw the game object, right? All right? Also, I see sprite node. Sprite node also comes from Cnode. So, a sprite node can also be used from Cnode as well to draw something, to draw a sprite. You can use either or to make your game objects. Okay. So, it says, an entity represents some game element in the world, other planes, projectiles, pickups. Basically, what the player can interact with. Going to have a velocity attribute. Anyone know what velocity means, guys? We're talking about this in the vector class, vector lecture. Velocities for speed, yes. So, I can make my plane move faster or slower exactly with velocity. So, velocity is a vector too, which means it has an X and a Y. It is a 2D game, game engine. So, that means that will be drawn on the X. This is an actual line tool here. On the X and the Y. Okay. So, I can set the speed. You can set the speed. All right. And also get the speed with a getter and a setter. Now, this is just quick questioning here, guys. What is a getter and a setter? Setter is going to set, right, set a vector. I can update it. And a getter will get the vector and return it. All right. So, here I'm setting it with what? I'm setting it. I'm setting it. Setting the velocity with a vector 2. Here I'm setting the velocity and Y with the, with two floats, X and Y. Here I'm getting the velocity with, get the velocity. Start training. Okay. So, it says explicit aircraft. It doesn't let the copy constructor implicitly be injected by the compiler. We cannot use here a copy constructor. We are actually using a explicit constructor. We have to pass in the type. So, a copy constructor pretty much is a constructor that allows me to copy. Like, I can make a copy of the object by passing in the same object into my constructor. We don't have that in our aircraft class. We have to actually specify the type of aircraft, and it will create that from the type. So, this can be either an Eagle or a Raptor. Okay. Oh, I don't know what happened here. It says define a 3 by 3 transform matrix. A transform specifies how to translate, rotate, scale, and I think it says sphere, project. I can't really read this. So, a transform, guys, will allow us to move along 2D space. So, a transform has 3 different parts. Translation, some moving position, rotation, and scale. Okay. So, translation, right, we're moving things in space by the position. Rotation, we're rotating things. And scale, we're making things larger and smaller, right? So, translation, I'm moving the X and Y positioning. Orientation, I'm moving the rotation. And scaling, right, I'm scaling things and making them larger or smaller. I don't see that in here. Let's see if I can find the... I think that's like... Yeah, I don't think that's a class in here. It says transformable. I don't think there's a class in here. So, accessors, garrison setters, right? Garrison setters, right? So, set position, I can set the position, right? Move, rotate, get scale, set origin, and get origin. This is high-level classes, so the sprite, text, and shape are derived from transformable and drawable. Let me see if sprite has that in it. Sprite node. Oh, I come from a C node. I don't see syntax. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, SF view. View defines a camera in the 2D scene. This is a very powerful concept. You can scroll, rotate, or zoom the entire scene without altering the way your drawable objects are drawn. View is composed of a source rectangle, which defines what part of the 2D scene is shown, and a target viewport, which defines where the contents of the source rectangle will be displayed on render target. So, guys, view is a camera in our scene. Now, if I look up SFML. Right here. So, view, right, this pretty much will set the view, the viewport of our game. Okay. Now, what is a viewport, guys? A viewport is pretty much a camera for the game. So, guys, every single game has a camera to show the game. So, everything inside here is pretty much the game being shown on a camera. So, every single game you guys create, right, it's using a camera to show the actual scene in the game. I'm trying to find the code here. Oh, here it is. If you guys go to world.hpp, there is a view here. And it says 2D camera defines the region it's shown on screen. So, we see view here. So, you can see we have a vector 2 for the center and the sides of the view. All right. All right. So, guys, if you guys really get into the game, you can see that the game is actually a 2D game. So, if you guys really get into the game, you can see that the game is actually a 2D game. All right. So, guys, if you guys really get into creating an engine from scratch, it's beautiful. But you'll see every single part of the game engine that you need to make, and you will learn this, guys. And once you learn it, you'll never forget it. Every single game that you make has a camera. Do you guys ever use Unity before? Unity or Unreal? Anybody uses these engines before? So, with Unity, Unity has a camera in it, guys, that pretty much allows you to see the entire world. And you can move the camera around. You can move the camera around to change the viewport of the game. It's very, very important you understand that. Every single game has a view. Let me see what the book says about this. Every single game has a view. That's the TVs. Right. There it is. Aircraft. Chapter three, we were talking about rendering a scene. So the scene node is the next one I'm talking about. The scene node, guys, allows us to add entities to our scene. So this is all about chapter three. So it says scene graph. A scene graph is developed to transform the hierarchies. Consists of multiple nodes called C nodes. Each node can store an object that is drawn, represented by a class called C node. To store the children, we use a vector container, vector C node, which will contain all the C nodes in the scene. So let's go to C node. So C node allows us to hold children within our scene. Right. So in a C node, we can draw children. We can add them to our scene. Right. We can update the entire scene. Okay. So this guy is used to hold an array of nodes. Here it is. So our children, guys, are pretty much a huge tree of nodes that we can render in the scene. So it's a huge tree of nodes. Right. A large tree of nodes, guys. So what are nodes? Nodes are just pretty much objects in our scene that we can use. So class C node. Okay. Here we can see there's a pointer for a C node. There are children, and there's a parent. The parent is here, and it comes and creates children that can add more and more children. And the scene node, the scene graph, just keeps growing. Right. So, guys, this is how our scene is built. Sorry, I know I can't draw very well, but this is how our scene is built. Our scene is built, guys, by us adding nodes to our scene. They're all children. Right. So, guys, making game engines is a beautiful thing, guys. Take this course seriously, not only because you'll be making your own game engine, but because you can make a game engine. And, guys, making a game engine, all joke aside, if you can make a game engine from scratch in C++, you are guaranteed a job in the game industry. I'll tell you that. That's the hardest thing to do as a game developer. If you can get the entire game engine from scratch, I'm talking about the front end and also have networking in it. So, you can have local, local player, multiplayer. You can have the whole thing working, the graphics, the audio, the C rendering. It's culling, meaning that it's saving memory properly. Memory leaks are not happening. Everything's working fine. Then you can definitely get a job in the industry. Even using this, this is very low level still. Even though we have a game engine, this is still, like, you still have to create it yourself. You still have to use C++. You still have to, like, make everything on your own. So, this is still impressive. Like, if you don't use, it's very, very hard and unrealistic to use, like, from scratch, from scratch, like that. Like, making something from super scratch. If you can do that, then even better. But, having something like this, if you can use this, guys, and actually, like, create an awesome game with this, right, from using C++, that's a good, that's very good. If you can make your own engine, like, without using SFML, like David asked, even better. But, if you guys can make your own game from this, right, and it works well, you can add it to your portfolio, you can really show that to an employer, and they'd be impressed. I'll tell you that right now. Because, nowadays, guys, people use Unity, they use Unreal, and they rely on that. But, Unity and Unreal does everything for you. They do most of the heavy lifting for you. Right? So, things like drawing, culling, these are done by the engine. Right? But, if you use something like this, or even if you go even further, like, you make your own engine, then it's more impressive. So, just so you guys know, I have a degree in game development, and I spoke to people who are in the industry, they have told me this. So, make sure that you understand how to do this, by the end of this course, you are able to make your own game in SFML. Everyone should be able to hear it, but make sure that you add it to your portfolio. Cnode class. So, we provide an interface to insert or remove child nodes. Void attach child. So, void cnode attach child. So, I can add children to my scene. Okay. So, function pointers, and lambda functions. Before to move on to the next slide, we need to know function pointers. A pointer to a function, and a lambda function, which is a new way, a C++11 way, to have a pointer to a function. Much more powerful than pointer to function. So, function pointers lets you pass a function to a function. Sometimes you need a generic function to be passed from a function, and call the pass function. One of the popular usage of function pointer is to have a callback function for GUI components. So, void create button, int x, int y, text, function, callback function. So, void my int func, print x, int main, void foo int, foo, this is going to take the address of my int func. So, void my int func, print x, int main, void foo, this is going to take the address of my int func. So, this says lambda function. Lambda function is an inline function. You define the header and implementation of the place you need the function. So, int main, auto func, right, equals empty func, call the function. Empty array is called capture specification, tells the compiler we're creating a lambda function. This specifies the list of arguments for the function. You don't need to specify the return type after C++11. Now, it says here, lambda function's variable capturing is used in the capture specification. So, int main, string, my name equals nick, auto func. Don't worry too much about this, I'm just telling you a different way of calling functions. So, it says here, lambda function captures nothing, captures by reference, captures a copy of the reference variable, equals my variable, captures a copy of the first reference variable, and a reference to my variable, captures a copy of my variable. So, SceneNode class. So, the SceneNode class, like I said before, we're using the SceneNode class to do what? The SceneNode class has a reference of scene nodes, which are children in the scene. Every scene has children inside them, and a parent. So, I can actually find the node. I can find the node, looking through my scene nodes. So, let's go back to our code here, SceneNode. Attach child, update, get position, we're drawing them. So, I can go to attach child. This will attach the child that we have here into our mChildren. So, mChildren will be all the children we have in our scene. Attach child will remove that child from mChildren. We're going to be taking off the child object from the array. We're going to be taking off the child object. We're going to be taking off the child object. So, we're going to take off the child object. So, the class can then be used by, right, in your window to draw the node. Let's see the render window. Somewhere here. It's already fine, guys. You're going to go through the code and find all the classes you need. Windows here. Yeah, draw. World. M window. Draw. M window. Is. What is M window? That's window object. We have there. Here it is. Render window. Render window can construct a window for us. We draw. Our scene. Okay. Aircraft. So, aircraft is the actual game object that's drawing the airplane that comes from entity. So, public aircraft. We're making aircraft here. Right. Different types of aircrafts we have are Raptor and Eagle. We're setting the origin. By default, the origin of sprites is in the upper left corner. So, for alignment or rotation, it might be better to work the center. We can set it thus. Float rack bounds. MSprite.local bounds. Right. Set origin. So, guys, the origin of the sprite. Let's say this is a sprite. It's in the upper left corner. Right here. So, 00 is there. Make it bigger. 00 of a sprite object is here. Meaning that if I'm going to reference the sprite object, know that everything will origin from here. Okay. So, if I want to center the origin, I could do bounds.width divided by two and bounds.height divided by two, which would be the center right here. Which you guys should probably do. It says it might be better to work with the center. We'll set it like that. So, you probably want to set the origin of the sprite to the center. That way, everything starts in the middle of the sprite and not from the edge. Scene layers. So, different nodes must be rendered in a certain order. Right. So, layer background, layer count. Guys, just so you know, a scene can have layers. So, background, layer and layer. So, basically, guys, the layers make up the scene. It might be the background behind. Maybe it has the clouds and the sea and the grass. And then here, the second layer might have player objects. And maybe the foreground layer has like fog in front of it. So, you want to make sure your layers are ordered properly to get the right effect. Update the scene. During an update, entities move and interact, collisions are checked, and projectiles are launched. You can add a file in the scene node. Update, children, update current, and update. I'll go back to my code here. Scene node. Scene update is here. And this is used to update all the children in my class. Now, what does update do? You can see here, update has time. This is used to move the player around the scene. All right. Absolute transforms. This is in order to find out if two objects collide. We have to look at the world transform, not local relative transforms. I don't see anything. Okay, so transform scene node, get world transform. We can get the current transform, meaning the current position of the node using get world transform. So I can get the transform, which consists of what, guys? The position, right? The scale and the orientation of any scene node. Here, I can get the position of the scene node. The view. In our case, a view is a rectangle and represents the subset of our world that we want to render at a particular time. We're provided a class called SFView. With the view, we can scroll, zoom, and rotate with ease. So sprite node class represents a background sprite, so sprite node. Sprite node, right? We can use it to create a sprite. Again, from last class, we talked about how to draw textures. So the texture is used. Right? Texture is used, guys. Texture is used to draw a sprite. We're giving it a texture, and then we're drawing the sprite with that texture. I think you guys should be all good by now. I think everyone in the class has a hang of, well, kind of. Not fully yet, obviously, but we're getting a hang of using this engine by now. Sprite node class. Diagram below, the gray classes are part of SFML, and the black ones are ours. So SFDrawable, SFTransformable, and SFNoncopyable are all part of SFML, and these ones are our classes. So CNode. If you guys see SF before, you know it's a part of SFML. This stuff is what we made from SFML. Texture repeating. So an SFTexture comes along with the option to enable repeating along both axes with SFTexture set repeated. All right. Composing the world. The world class must contain all rendering data. The reference to the render window, the world's current view, a texture holder with all textures needed inside the world, the scene graph, right, and some pointers to access the scene's graph layer nodes. The boundary rectangle of the world, storing its dimensions. The position where the player's plane appears in the beginning, the speed with which the world is scrolled, and a pointer to the player's aircraft. The world class, let's go look at that here. What does it need? Let's look at it again. So a reference to render window is here. The current view, a texture holder with all textures needed inside the world, and the scene graph. All right. Then the scene layers. Our scenes. And the bounds, so how big the world is. The position where players will spawn from. And the scroll speed per aircraft. So for today's exercise guys, you're going to be making a 2D game using the aircraft. So it won't have collision in it. It won't have any collision. But you'll be using the aircraft to create a sprite within a scene. Maybe it's like a 2D scroller. When I press left and right, maybe the background can scroll. And you can also add enemy aircrafts in it as well. That will be your lab for today. Start to think about how you would do that. So the world class pretty much has a reference to all of these things here. Which we can use to create our game world. So the render window, how we'll draw the scene. The view, how it will display the scene. A reference to our textures to use to draw our sprites. A scene graph, which will hold a reference to all of our sprites. Sprite notes. Layers, which we can use to layer our scene. The bounds, how big our scene will be. The position where our player will spawn from. The scroll speed, so how fast the screen will scroll. And our aircraft, which is our player. So the world bounds, guys, pretty much is going to be the dimensions of the screen. This shows you how to scroll the screen, guys. You can have scrolling. Now, I believe you have to use a reference to a textbook. I think a textbook, if you go through the example chapter 3, you should be able to build it. And you probably will see the scene scrolling in there. So you should be able to use that as a reference. So world, load textures. I can load an eagle, raptor, or a desert using load textures. What's left? Remember that the main function is our entry point. So the main function is here, guys. Main.cpp. We're running our game class. So the game is pretty much going to build the world. The world is going to build the scene. The scene has, so let's go in here, world. What does the world do? It builds a scene. The scene has our player object inside of it. So you kind of can see, guys, how our game will be structured. So we can start to look at everything from there, including all the classes we looked at. The scene is built in a world build scene method. The update and draw methods of the world encapsulates scene graph functionality. The run function in main gets everything going. So this is how this works, guys. Any questions? All right, guys. So we went through the first slide. The second slide will be the next week, which we mentioned one week. So we're going to be doing two slides in one class. With this, input handling, we'll take a break, guys. We'll come back and we'll go through the slide. We'll take a 15-minute break. We'll be right back. Guys, we're talking about input handling now. So the code is there under week six. You guys can download that. I think it adds on to the week five code. So it says here, examine SFML events and explore their purpose as input. Assess real-time input and evaluate its difference from events. Analyze and reproduce a command-based communication system to deliver events. Explore how dynamically bind keys at runtime. So polling events. So events are objects that are triggered when something happens. Okay? So this can be user input. Behind the scene, the OS reports an event to the application. So SFML processes such a report and converts it into a corresponding SFML event type. So we can use the window poll event function. The signature is SFWindowPollEvent. Now, I don't see in this window class, I do not see that event there. I think it's directly from the SF window class. I don't see that here. So poll event. So if you guys do this, you can say pop the event. On top is the event queue. If any in return, the function is now blocking. This is going to be used to poll the event. So then you're going to pass the event inside here. So whatever the event was. There's different types of events, guys. If you go to the – if you use the API a lot, the API does help you. If you go to search event, there are different types of events. There's keyboard events, mouse events, joystick events. You would have to just pass the event that it is into that function to actually listen to that event. So it says, generally, we want to poll an event with an event parameter as well as a rule that will tell us to keep polling the event or not. So it says, while window.pollEvent event, handle the event. Different types of events here. So there's text, enter, key pressed, key released, mouse wheel moved, mouse wheel scrolled, mouse button pressed, right? Mouse button pressed, released, blah, blah, touch moved. So, guys, in your case, most likely you'd be using the mouse or the keyboard. This is not a mobile class, so we're not using touch. I mean, you guys probably have not hooked up your joypad yet. You shouldn't worry about that yet until the end. Maybe at the end of class you can do that. But for now, you should be just using a keyboard and a mouse. Like I said, you guys go to the API. You should be able to see different events that we can use in SFML. Events. We can group events in four different categories, window, joystick, keyboard, mouse, touch screen, and sensors, which is accelerometer, gyroscope, manometer, gravity, acceleration, and orientation. For now, we're just using these two. These are the main events. And maybe windows sometimes. If you resize a window, that is also an event. But these are the main events we use. Window events. Window events can serve as a directory. So if we close a window, that's also an event. Occurring when a user requests that a window should be closed, press an X or Alt F4, for example, this will close the window. Resize, like I said. Windows resized. User drags edges to manually resize it. Window must be enabled to be resized. This is a size event. You can say event.size. A loss focus, gain of focus means that I clicked away or I clicked on the window. Joystick event. Whenever a joystick or game patch is in state, joystick button pressed, joystick button released. Joystick moved. Joystick moved. If I move the joystick, this will also trigger an event. Guys, like I said, do not worry about this yet. You want to get the keyboard events working first. This is just getting the joystick once you get that accessed. You can do that. Now, key pressed. This is what I would be worrying about for today's lab. So you want to make sure you can get this to work. Like I said, guys, there's an example in the book code. You can go over it. I'm not sure how to do this properly. So it says data structures associated as SF event, key event, with a member, event.key.code. Guys, there's many key codes that are associated with each key. If you go to the key codes, let's see if the book has any examples of that. There it is. Keyboard events are here, key pressed, mouse events. Ah, there we go. Let me zoom in a little bit. You can see here it says if key, handle player input. Let's see if it's in the game class or not. So, handle event, this is if it's closed. It's not a keyboard event though. Ah, there we go. So, key pressed, handle player input, key code, key released. So guys, we'll check to see what key is pressed based on the key code. Alright, so you guys will need to handle open events by using this function. When I press a key, it will let me know what key is pressed. Now, if I press W, that's W. S is S, A is A, D is D. Actually, you can just use these to get key code just based on the letter of the key. You guys can actually use this to move the airplane. So, the airplane that we have in the scene, you can just say, W, S, D, and then this will move the airplane in a different direction. The airplane needs to be the end player. Here, guys, for you. You might have to go ahead and download that code there. But, this is going to be used to move the player in the game. So, the player should be the airplane. So, a lot of it is already done for you guys. You just got to put it together. That's the point of the class. Your goal is, I give you the code, and your goal is to put everything together and make sense of what's going on. So, you are going to be putting this together to get the airplane to move. So, now it says, key.control are booleans that state whether the control key is pressed. Alt, key.shift, and key.system are available as well. You can use this to press different keys. Key released, key pressed, text entered. Alright, so mouse entered, mouse left, mouse moved. These are all mouse events that we can also use. Click on the scene. Alright, we're going to be using this, guys, for the collision detection lab. We'll be using mouse clicks to fire projectiles at the enemy. So, that'll be fun. But, first, we can set it up by getting the input handling to work first with the keyboard and moving the player around the scene. Mouse orientation. So, as most platforms, coordinates are measured in window pixels. So, wherever you click, like if I click here, it's 0, 0. Alright, this is the coordinates that we get on the window. If I click here, it would be like, whatever it is, negative 10 and 10, something like that. But, this is where we can click, and we'll pretty much pick up the coordinate using the X and Y values. Mouse events. So, mouse button released, mouse button pressed. This is where we hold the mouse button down and release it. These are both two events that we can use to access the two different states. So, one state is pressed. The mouse button is pressed. And, released. And, mouse wheel moved. Anyone want to guess what that is? What that does? Kind of straightforward. What event would that be, guys? Mouse wheel moved. With the mouse wheel. Very straightforward, right? So, the middle button of the mouse, that's moved. Alright, handling inputs. Like I said, guys, in this function here, handlePlayerInput, you guys are using the keyboard to move the player around. And, this will eventually change the player velocity. Now, update. Now, once we move the player, it will set these booleans to true. And, if those booleans are true, then we will then set these, change the vector movement for the player. So, the player is going to be moving based on this vector. Based on this vector here, the player will move based on that vector. So, we have to make sure that the directions are right. Negative equals one for y. Right, we'll move it up, because if you look at the coordinate tree, right, down, it's like kind of backwards. So, going lesser is moving up. Moving lesser on the x is moving to the left. You have to remember that the coordinates are inverted. So, that's why negative one is going up. Positive one is going down. Same thing for left and right. So, negative one x is left, and positive one x is right. Update. Now, in the update, we can also use the keyboard as well here to affect the player's speed. And then this says move.movement. And then it will multiply by time. So, if you do it with time, guys, it looks more realistic, because it's multiplying the movement by time. So, it actually will move along with time inside that equation. So, it actually looks more realistic and more smooth if you use the multiply time of the movement, which will kind of give it a frame rate to move by. Events birth real-time input. So, if a state has changed, you should use events. However, if you want to know the current state, then, of course, you must check using a function. So, if event.type equals sfEventMouseButtonPressed, or the left mouse button can be pressed or something. So, sfMouse is button pressed, mouse left. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
